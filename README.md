The project consists of a model that aims to predict where the content of a message, included within contact form, is a spam or not. The project included multiple phases, including pre-process using NLP and modelling.
Multiple models were tested in the context of Supervised Models, then after evaluation, the best model was selected.
The problematic aimed to be binary classification and after real-time testing, the model that was selected satisfied the needs at minimal.
It should be noted that a further Recurrent Neural Network was indeed tested, yet the results were not effective and this approach will be revised within the future.
